# Execution Context

first global execution context is added to call stack
Whenever a code is run in js. Its part of an exection context that is the global()

First Global Object-> this

here
this===window

in node its global instead of window

```
var a = true
``
 now if we go to window
 ```
 window
 ```
 we will find the window is defined

 Hoisting happens in every execution context
